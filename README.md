# PunkAPI - Site

A very simple set of pages for `punkapi.com`, really nothing special going on here just some pages in the build directory and a build task using npm scripts for making the css a bit nicer to work with.

## Deploying
Probably not very useful for anyone else!

- Run `$ npm run deploy`
- Run `$ npm run alias` to realias the deploy to `site.punkapi.com`
